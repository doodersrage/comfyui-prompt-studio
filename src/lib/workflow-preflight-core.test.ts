// This module is the shared preflight gate used by both the client preview
// UI and the server /prompt queue path (see its own doc comment: "Keep
// Lightning + inventory checks here so UI and /prompt cannot diverge").
// It has no dedicated coverage of its own today - every sub-audit it calls
// (workflow-placeholder-audit, workflow-stack-fingerprint, etc.) has its own
// test file, but nothing exercises the orchestration logic that lives in
// this file itself: which audits run under which conditions, the
// objectInfoUnavailable severity branch, and the ok/error aggregation in
// summarizeWorkflowGraphPreflight.
